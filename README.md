# Future Ideas
- In furture i think it would be a nice idea to add in extra rounds with different levels of diffuclty.
- I also think it be a good idea to make a this into a series and have a quiz for each notable holiday/festival that happens during the calender year e.g Easter, Valentines Day, Christmas etc.
